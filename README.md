Chromatic Type Polynomial
=========================

A small cubical agda development to show that a type-theoretic
generalization of the usual graph polynomials that capture graph
colorings satisfies a contraction-deletion isomorphism.

The main theorem is in `chromatic/ContractionDeletion.agda`.

The proof relies on the standard library for cubical agda: https://github.com/agda/cubical
